            <h3>Companion Dog Chihuahua</h3>

                <p>
                    The Chihuahua is the smallest breed of dog, and is named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Chihuahua is thought to descend from the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec
                    civilization in Mexico.[4] No records of the Techichi are available before the 9th century, although
                    dog
                    pots from Colima, Mexico, buried as part of the western Mexico shaft tomb tradition, which date back
                    to
                    300 BC, are thought to depict Techichis.[5] The earlier ancestors probably had been present before
                    the
                    Mayas, as small dogs are found in materials from the Great Pyramid of Cholula, antedating 1530 and
                    in
                    the ruins of Chichen Itza on the Yucatán Peninsula.

                <h3>History</h3>
        
                <img class="history_image" src="assets/images/1076px-Chihuahua-Dog.jpg" alt="chihuahua deer head dog">
                <p>
                    In a 1520 letter, Hernan Cortés wrote
                    that the Aztecs raised and sold little dogs as food.[6] Colonial
                    records refer to small, nearly hairless dogs at the beginning of the 19th century, one of which
                    claims
                    16th-century Conquistadores found them plentiful in the region later known as Chihuahua.[7][page
                    needed]
                    Small dogs were also used as living heating pads during illness or injury. Some believe this
                    practice is
                    where the idea of pain being transferred to animals from humans originated, which gave way to
                    rituals
                    such as burning the deceased with live dogs, such as the Techichi, to exonerate the deceased human's
                    sins.[8]
                    Chihuahuas as we know them today remained a rarity until the early 20th century; the American Kennel
                    Club (AKC) did not register a Chihuahua until 1904.[9]

                <h3>Apple head vs. Deer head Chihuahuas</h3>
        
                <img class="head_image" src="assets/images/640px-Standard_razza_chihuahua.jpg"
                    alt="chihuahua apple head dog">
                <p>
                    Dogs of any coat type may be identified as either "apple head" or "deer head" Chihuahuas. Apple
                    heads
                    have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped
                    heads,
                    more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. Deer heads were the breed standard
                    conformation in the mid-20th century, but current breed standards defined by registries such as the
                    AKC specify the
                    apple-head conformation.[12]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Apple Head Chihuahua is known for having a round/apple-shaped head and a definite "stop" whereas
                    a
                    Deer Head Chihuahua "may" have a flatter head, thinner skull, but is unlikely to have a "stop" and
                    will
                    probably have a much longer nose. Their physical body shape is largely the same, except the Deer
                    Head Chihuahua
                    is known to have longer legs than other Chihuahuas.[21] The Deer Head Chihuahua tends to be larger
                    in
                    weight, where an Apple Head is more likely to keep their weight under ten pounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apple Head Chihuahuas are longer than they are tall and have shorter necks. Deer Head Chihuahuas
                    have
                    longer ears than Apple Heads and their head also has a slope-shaped form. Both Apple Head and Deer
                    Head can
                    have short hair or long hair. They also both come in various different colors such as brown, black,
                    tan, or
                    white. Chihuahuas can show traits from both Apple Head and Deer Head.[22]
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Deer Head Chihuahuas tend to have better health than Apple Heads, due to their longer noses".[This
                    quote
                    needs a citation] There is no scientific evidence that Apple Heads have a higher risk of getting
                    respiratory issues, due to having a smaller airway. Deer Headed Chihuahuas are not allowed in the
                    AKC due to not
                    meeting the standards that Apple Heads do. Deer Head Chihuahuas are not allowed because they have a
                    longer jaw
                    line and a slope that connects their muzzle and head, creating a 45 degree angle instead of a 90
                    degree angle
                    like the Apple Head. Apple Heads are allowed in the AKC and meet the requirements due to having a
                    smaller weight, having a rounder head, and also having a 90 degree angle formed by the muzzle to the
                    forehead.[13]
