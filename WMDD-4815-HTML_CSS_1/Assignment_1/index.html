      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am <strong>Sumeet Kumar</strong>. Basically, I'm from
      <strong>India</strong>, but currently I am living in
      <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>. I have a
      <strong>Bachelor's Degree</strong> in
      <em>"Computer Science and Engineering"</em> and I have worked as a
      <strong>Front-end Developer</strong> in <strong>Razorpod.in</strong> a
      startup in Gurugram, Haryana, India for almost a year before coming to
      Canada. I have some experience with <em>Bootstrap</em> and
      <em>Tailwind</em> frameworks which greatly helps in reducing the size of
      our code.

    <h4>
      Why I like Computer Games
    </h4>
    <p>
      Since my childhood I was into computers, growing up I found some really
      great games that got me into gaming. After getting introduced to internet
      I got to know about online multiplayer games and I really loved them. In
      my free time I play computer games which really helps me in refreshing my
      mind.

    <h4>
      Why I like cooking
    </h4>
    <p>
      I like cooking food because I am an <em>Epicure</em>. So, I like to cook
      different types of food and so, when I cook it myself it tastes even
      better.

    <!-- Why do you think downloading the smallest sized image makes a difference?
     Small size means the browser has to download less data to display the image which ultimately,
     reduces the loading time of the page. Which is a good thing.
     Why do we need an alt attribute in our image element?
     The alt attribute is to add a text describing the image because the purpose of a good webpage
     is that its content is accessible to everyone. So, like for people who can't see uses the 
     screen reader to browse through webpages. When the screen reader comes to an image it uses 
     the alt text to describe the image to the user. If we do not add any alt text to the image, 
     the screen reader will not be able to describe the image to the user and the user might miss
     some important information which is only provided by the image and this will greatly impact 
     the user experience on that webpage.
