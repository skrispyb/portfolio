          The Japanese rock garden (枯山水, karesansui) or "dry landscape" garden, often called a zen garden, creates a
          miniature stylized landscape through carefully composed arrangements of rocks, water features, moss, pruned
          trees and bushes, and uses gravel or sand that is raked to represent ripples in water.[1] A zen garden is
          usually relatively small, surrounded by a wall, and is usually meant to be seen while seated from a single
          viewpoint outside the garden, such as the porch of the hojo, the residence of the chief monk of the temple or
          monastery.

          French Formal Garden

          TThe French formal garden, also called the jardin à la française (literally, "garden in the French manner" in
          French), is a style of garden based on symmetry and the principle of imposing order on nature. Its epitome is
          generally considered to be the Gardens of Versailles designed during the 17th century by the landscape
          architect
          André Le Nôtre for Louis XIV and widely copied by other European courts.[1]

          The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both
          the
          vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress,
          and
          the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants,
          made
          for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant
          to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.[1]

          Italian Renaissance Garden

        <p>
          The Italian Renaissance garden was a new style of garden which emerged in the late 15th century at villas in
          Rome and Florence, inspired by classical ideals of order and beauty, and intended for the pleasure of the view
          of the garden and the landscape beyond, for contemplation, and for the enjoyment of the sights, sounds and
          smells of the garden itself.
